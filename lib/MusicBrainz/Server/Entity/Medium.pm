=head2 length

Attempt to return the duration of the medium in microseconds.  This
will return the length of the disc, by looking at the associated
discids or tracklists.

This will not load any data from the database, so make sure you load
either the associated tracklists + tracks, the MediumCDTOC +
CDTOC, or both.
